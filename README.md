# Create a Tech Gadget Customer Support Chatbot  
 Imagine you own an online store that sells various tech gadgets. Customers frequently ask about product details, return policies, shipping options, and technical troubleshooting. Instead of handling every question manually, you decide to implement a simple chatbot to provide quick responses.

## Your Chatbot Will Handle Queries Like:
1. Product Information: “Tell me about product X”, “Do you have smartwatches?”  
2. Shipping Details: “How long does shipping take?”, “What shipping methods are available?”  
3. Return Policy: “What is your return policy?”, “How do I return a product?”  
4. Technical Support: “My gadget won’t turn on”, “How do I reset my device?”  
## Run Your Chatbot
1. Click inside the cell containing the chatbot code.  
2. Press Run in the menu bar to run the chatbot.  
3. Type in different customer questions to see how the chatbot responds.  
4. To exit the chatbot, type "bye" or "exit".
